<h1><b>C – for loop in C programming with example</b></h1>

A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition returns false.
<h2>C For loop</h2>
This is one of the most frequently used loop in <a target="_blank" href="https://beginnersbook.com/2014/01/c-tutorial-for-beginners-with-examples/"> C programming.</a>

<h3>Syntax of for loop:</h3>
<div class="code">
    <pre>
        for (initialization; condition test; increment or decrement)
        {{'{'}}
            //Statements to be executed repeatedly
        {{'}'}}
    </pre>
</div>

<h2>Flow Diagram of For loop</h2>

<p>
    <b>Step 1:</b> First initialization happens and the counter variable gets initialized.<br>
    <b>Step 2:</b> In the second step the condition is checked, where the counter variable is tested for the given condition, if the condition returns true then the C statements inside the body of for loop gets executed, if the condition returns false then the for loop gets terminated and the control comes out of the loop.<br>
    <b>Step 3:</b> After successful execution of statements inside the body of loop, the counter variable is incremented or decremented, depending on the operation (++ or –).
</p>
<h2>Example of For loop</h2>

<div class="code">
    <pre>
        #include < stdio.h>
        int main()
        {{'{'}}
            int i;
            for (i=1; i&lt;=3; i++)
            {{'{'}}
                printf("%d\n", i);
            {{'}'}}
            return 0;
        {{'}'}}
    </pre>
</div>
<div class="code">
    <h4>Output :</h4>
    <pre>
        1
        2
        3
    </pre>
</div>
<h3><b>Various forms of for loop in C</b> </h3>
    
<p>
   I am using variable num as the counter in all the following examples –<br>
    <b>1)</b> Here instead of num++, I’m using num=num+1 which is same as num++.
</p>
<pre>
    for (num=10; num&lt;20; num=num+1)
</pre>

<p>
   <b>2)</b>  Initialization part can be skipped from loop as shown below, the counter variable is declared before the loop

</p>
<pre>
    int num=10;
    for (;num&lt;20;num++)
</pre>
<p>
   <b><u> Note: </u></b>Even though we can skip initialization part but semicolon (;) before condition is must, without which you will get compilation error.<br>
    <b>3)</b> Like initialization, you can also skip the increment part as we did below. In this case semicolon (;) is must after condition logic. In this case the increment or decrement part is done inside the loop.
   
</p>
<div class="code">
    <pre>
        for (num=10; num&lt;20; )
        {{'{'}}
            //Statements
            num++;
        {{'}'}}
    </pre>
</div>
